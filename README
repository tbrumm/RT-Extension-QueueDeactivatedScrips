NAME
  RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips

DESCRIPTION
  If you have a large amount of Queues and you don't like to manage
  all scrips per queue by hand, this extension offers a way to
  create global scrips and enable and disable them on a queue level.
  This Extension is based on Dirk Pape's HideGlobalScrip AddOn and
  pushed to RT 3.8.x.

  We had to replace the Admin/Queues/Scrips.html file with a pathed
  Version. If you have already made changes to the file, please
  compare and patch again.

  We also had to patch Admin/Elements/EditScrips. Inside RT 3.8.x
  this file is completely different from older versions, so we
  replaced the entire content. 

INSTALLATION
  1. Run "perl Makefile.PL"

  2. Run "make"

  3. Run "make install" (you may need root permissions)
  
  4. Run "make initdb" for first time installation

  5. Additionally, if you're running 3.8, you'll need to add
     "RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips" to @Plugins in
     etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm.  For example:
     Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::QueueDeactivatedScrips));

  6. Clear RT's mason cache and restart the web server to make sure the
     extension is incorporated.

TODO
  EditScrips inside RT 3.8.x works different like older versions,
  we have replaced the file with an older version, this runs fine
  so far, but i like to have all clean. Patches are welcome.
